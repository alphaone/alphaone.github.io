Torsten is easily one of the best developers I've worked with in my 20-year
programming career.

In addition to all the usual strengths of a seasoned developer, he possesses
two key skills: the ability and dedication to **deliver transparent,
maintainable solutions to complex requirements**, and a willingness to mentor
other developers to help them understand and develop those solutions further.

It's been eye-opening for me to see how his values of communication and
mentoring help build extremely effective teams. He is universally lauded by my
colleagues and with good reason: **he's made every one of us better
developers.**
