Torsten is a rare person and colleague - one of those persons that makes one
believe in humanity, leadership, intelligence and humility.

His intelligence, leadership and clarity of person and thought is extraordinary.

First regarding his work competence and productivity - Torsten drove the
development of two backend architectures for our high resolution visual game.
Alongside this **he built a team that constantly upped their game**, remained
constant and stable, understood the strategy and complexities, and developed as
engineers, leaders and most importantly humans.

He asks question over question in order to understand. He is not afraid to
stand up to prevailing thinking or dogma in order to challenge the status quo
on a technical decision. He does this with grace and carefulness. I don't think
I have met anyone who is so **clear in conveying their point of view**, and yet so
delicate and strong in delivering the verdict.

Regarding his leadership - Torsten gets real benefit and flow in teaching and
developing engineers, yet never wants the accolades or title that accompany
this. He is a **true believer in servant leadership**, seeing his role as one that
serves others and achieving honest gratification in leaving his team members
stronger and more confident in every way.

I have the highest confidence in recommending this extraordinary mind and
leader to future work collaborations. Any business is very very lucky to have
him.
