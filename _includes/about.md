I like to be called a generalist and was able to gain experience in software
development over the last 20 years. Since I am used to switch roles between
**developer, tester and coach**, I tend to fastly become a real enrichment
for every cross-functional team.

As an experienced **software developer with a strong focus on quality**,
I aim for sharing my knowledge and experiences with my team colleagues.
I do that by setting a good example and showing during my daily work how to:
* write clean, readable and comprehensible (and therefor maintainable) code
* write the right tests, so that they guide and help you, instead of hinder you
* learn and internalize the critical thinking of a tester
* use Continuous Delivery to improve quality and reduce risk
* use a minimum of documentation to help everyone on the team

Since a couple of years I fell as a part of the **functional programming** community, 
but also had the chance to gain alot of experience with "classical" paradigms.
As a **polyglot developer**, I look into new languages and concepts every now and than,
and try to recognize and leverage their unique strengths. 

Whenever I am in project for a longer time, I tend to found **communities of
practice** (e.g. software craft, testing) with colleagues of mine, to encourage
knowledge exchange between different teams or even companies. Additionally
I regularly visit **meet ups and conferences** (both as speaker and as attendee) 
to see further than the end of my own nose.

To be able to successfully bring our ideas of modern software development into 
the world, I **founded a company** named [inoxio Quality Services GmbH](https://inoxio.de) 
together with two friends in 2007. Since then countless projects all
over Germany utilised our know-how in the fields of development, testing and 
operations.
