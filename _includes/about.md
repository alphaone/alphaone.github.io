I like to be called a generalist and was able to gain experience in software
development over the last 20 years. Since I am used to switching roles between 
**developer, tester, and coach**, I tend to rapidly become a real enrichment 
for every cross-functional team.

As an experienced **software developer with a strong focus on quality**,
I aim for sharing my knowledge and experiences with my team colleagues.
I do that by setting a good example and showing during my daily work how to:
* write clean, readable and comprehensible (and therefore maintainable) code
* write the right tests, so that they guide and help you, instead of hinder you
* learn and internalize the critical thinking of a tester
* use Continuous Delivery to improve quality and reduce risk
* use a minimum of documentation to help everyone on the team

For a couple of years I feel like a part of the **functional programming** community, 
but also had the chance to gain a lot of experience with "classical" paradigms.
As a **polyglot developer**, I look into new languages and concepts every now and then
and try to recognize and leverage their unique strengths. I have written 
production code in TypeScript, Clojure, Ruby and Go, just to name the most 
recent ones. 

Whenever I am in a project for a longer time, I tend to establish **communities of
practice** (e.g. software craft, testing) with colleagues of mine, to encourage
knowledge exchange between different teams or even companies. Additionally,
I regularly visit **meetups and conferences** (both as a speaker and an attendee) 
to see further than the end of my own nose.

To be able to successfully bring our ideas of modern software development into 
the world, I **founded a company** named [inoxio Quality Services GmbH](https://inoxio.de) 
together with two friends in 2007. Since then countless projects all
over Germany and Europe utilized our know-how in the fields of development, 
testing, and operations.
