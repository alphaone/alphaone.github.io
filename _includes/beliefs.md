In case that your beliefs do not match mine, we should definitely
[have a word](#contact).
I would love to hear which principles are making your projects successful.

### There is no silver bullet

There are no best practices. No single technology can be the answer to an existing problem.
Each challenge has to be seen in the context of the current circumstances.

### Continuous Improvement

Only if a team wants to improve itself every single day, it can achieve great things.
Retrospectives with their **blameless causal investigation** are cornerstones for the
continuous improvement of a team. Small experiments with measurable results help to
adapt the team's structure and mode of operation to its current needs.

### Quality

**You don't need testers to ensure quality**. Every team member can learn and internalize
the critical thinking of a tester and so influence the quality of the product right from
the start. You may need quality advocates to accompany and guide the team in this process.

### Transparency

**Believing is not knowing**. Only with correctly measured data, one can make
informed decisions. Everything else is guessing. The transparency of a product
can be improved with a comprehensive monitoring solution.

In the same way can tests, with their ability to verify and document essential aspects,
deliver a clearer picture of internal processes of a system.

### Test pyramid

Too many tests on the wrong level of the test pyramid make your tests slow,
unstable, unnecessarily complicated, and hard to maintain. In the same time,
you lose the biggest advantage of a good test suite: your ability to make changes
with confidence.

A **nicely balanced test pyramid**, on the other hand, gives you fast feedback, shows
which change led to unwanted side effects and verifies both the correctness of single
components and their proper interaction.
