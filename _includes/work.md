- For a gaming start-up in the UK, **I lead the backend development team** and
  designed, implemented and maintained a **Event-driven microservice
  architecture** that served as a backend for an upcoming high-volume mobile
  game.  
  _TypeScript_, _Go_, _MongoDB_, _Kafka_
- I led the backend development team, which provided the logic and the content
  for the different game clients via a GraphQL API.
  Additionally we built several tools to administrate and manage the content of
  the game.  
  _TypeScript_, _Ruby on Rails_, _Clojure_, _Go_, _GraphQL_
- We **migrated a legacy REST API to a new GraphQL API**, extracting small
  services from the monolith where useful. All while keeping the service
  continuously available to our user base.  
  _TypeScript_, _Ruby on Rails_, _Clojure_, _Go_, _GraphQL_, _AWS_, _Terraform_
- For a big German eCommerce platform, my team and I built a recommendation
  solution with a polyglot microservice architecture. And as good DevOps,
  we ran the operation ourselves.  
  50+ Services, _Clojure_, _Scala_, _Python_, _Kafka_, _Tensorflow_, _Redis_, _REST_
- The whole microservice landscape was migrated from a company-owned
  data center into **Amazon's Cloud** with zero downtime.  
  _AWS_, _Terraform_
- For our own company, I planned and developed a tailored **invoice and
  accounting system**, which is used successfully for over 10 years and is
  enhanced and improved every now and then.  
  _Ruby on Rails_, _HTML_, _SCSS_, _Javascript_, _Docker_, _AWS_
- Since in complex systems insufficient transparency is often jointly responsible
  for poor quality, I established holistic monitoring and alerting solutions
  for different projects.  
  _TypeScript_, _Go_, _Clojure_, _ClojureScript_, _Prometheus_, _Grafana_, _OpenTelemetry_
- Software, that isn't maintained, rots away quickly. I have always a special interest
  to **improve the code quality** of the software I am working on **as a daily routine**.
  At the end of the day, I want to have less technical debt, better test coverage or less
  accidental complexity in the system.
