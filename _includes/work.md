* For a big german eCommerce platform, my team and I built a recommendation
  solution with a ployglot microservice architecture. And as good DevOps
  we ran the operation ourselves.  
  50+ Services, _Clojure_, _Scala_, _Python_, _Kafka_, _Tensorflow_, _Redis_, _REST_
  
* The whole microservice landscape was migrated from a company-owned
  data center into **Amazon's Cloud** with zero downtime.  
  _AWS_, _Terraform_
  
* For our own company I planned and developed a tailored **invoice and 
  accounting system**, which is used successfully for over 10 years and is
  enhanced and improved every now and then.    
  _Ruby on Rails_, _HTML_, _SCSS_, _Javascript_, _Docker_, _AWS_
  
* Since in complex systems insufficient transparency is often jointly responsible
  for poor quality, I established holistic monitoring and alerting solutions
  for different projects.  
  _Clojure_, _ClojureScript_, _Prometheus_, _Grafana_, _Graphite_, _Kibana_
  
* Besides time series data teams often have to boldly visualize team specific data.
  I developed tools, so that the teams can monitor those information with ease.
  These tools showed amongst others:
  
  - for each repo, the number of commits, that are not deployed to LIVE yet
  - the state of all autoscaling instances in the cloud
  - the run time and status of long running jobs
  - the quality of various recommendation types, so that stakeholders can evaluate those better 
  
  _Clojure_, _Ruby_, _Python_, _Go_, _HTML_, _SCSS_, _Javascript_, diverse Service-APIs

* Software, that isn't maintained, rots away quickly. I have always a special interest
  to **improve the code quality** of the software I am working on **as a daily routine**.
  At the end of the day I want to have less technical debt, better test coverage or less
  accidental complexity in the system.
